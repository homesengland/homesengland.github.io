title: Team Health Check

The Team Health Check is a self-evaluation tool, a workshop format, to help you improve and become stronger as a team. The goal of the workshop is to increase self-awareness, trigger discussion on how you can improve as a team and how you can be even more successful at collaboratively deliver value to your users and stakeholders.

These take place once a month usually alongside a retro. It focuses on themes rather than specific project issues.

#### Benefits

Running a Team Health Check with the teams will:

*   Increase awareness of where the team is at, it’s state, challenges and opportunities
*   Trigger discussions within each team with regards to their current state of health.
*   Generate improvement actions within the team, as any good retrospective.
*   Highlight to leadership how they can support as servant leaders or in which way the can tackle specific challenges across teams
*   Communicates good desired behaviours (such as collaboration, feedback, integrity) as well as what teams should be allowed to expect from the leadership of the organization (support, trust, involvement, connection to purpose and why).

#### Not just for teams

Although health checks are primarily used by delivery or operational teams, it can be used by leadership, communities and other Governance or advisory forums. It’s always a good idea to reflect and think about if you are achieving what you set out to do or if/should that change.

#### Voting

Each topic comes with two set of examples. If you think the green statement best exemplifies how things are, you vote green. If you think the red statement best exemplifies how things are, you vote red.

If you’ve seen both green and red examples, or believe things are neither green nor red, you vote yellow. Green doesn’t necessarily mean things are perfect, nor does red mean that things are v. bad.

#### Topics

The health check itself consists of 11 topics. For each topic, there is a green and red statement. The green statement describes a healthy or positive example. The red, an unhealthy or bad example.
