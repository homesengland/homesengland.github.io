At Homes England we believe in making decisions based on evidenced user needs. User researchers, help multidisciplinary teams learn about users and recognise the value of user research. There is no single right way of doing this, but as a team, we need to stay unified in the way we approach, do, and talk about research.

### User research principles

*   Our principles are not rules. They guide our work, keep us improving as a team, and working with, not for our clients.
*   Help teams understand people
*   Researchers at Homes England help our teams build a deep understanding of the people who use our services. We know that‘s the best way to create public services that work well for the people who need them.
*   We are facilitators, not gatekeepers. We actively involve our colleagues and clients in research. And openly share what we do, how we do it and why it‘s important.

### Find the truth. Tell the truth

*   Researchers at Homes England create strong evidence and reliable answers so our teams can act with confidence. We are bold and focus on what‘s most important.
*   We know we can learn things that are unexpected and challenging. So we communicate clearly and sensitively to help everyone make the best decision.
*   Researchers know that the safety and trust of participants is our responsibility. We think about the ethics of our research at every step. From how we recruit participants and get their informed consent, through how we store and use the data we collect, to how we share our findings.
*   Be methodical, but not rigid
*   Researchers at Homes England know that the quality of our findings depends on the quality of our methods. We use tried and tested methods, and take time to reflect and continually improve our practice.
*   But we also understand that context is important. So we use the best approach for the question at hand and adapt our ways of working to fit the client and the project
*   Learn, share and adapt
*   Researchers at Homes England work in an agile way. We do research and analysis in small batches so we can continuously share and adapt to what we learn.
*   Make research inclusive
*   Researchers at Homes England know how important it is that public services work for all the people who need to use them. We help teams understand the needs of all their users, and do research activities that everyone can participate in.
*   Build on existing evidence
*   Researchers at Homes England help clients build on the knowledge and data they already have. We combine existing knowledge, poorly understood data and new research into a coherent picture.
*   Accept and admit constraints
*   Researchers at Homes England do the best research they can within the constraints we have. User researchers will acknowledge and share the limits of their research and findings. And we as a group should advocate for more research when it‘s needed to achieve the project outcomes.
*   The guide will eventually the user research workflow, which describes the things that user researchers usually do on projects, and then provides further guidance and links to resources for specific topics.
