In the UK, at least 1 in 5 people have a long term illness, impairment or disability, and many more have a temporary or situational disability.

Accessibility means making sure services and content can be used and understood by the widest possible audience. As a public sector organisation, we must remove as many barriers or obstacles to accessing our services as possible.

For example, this means we must make sure that you don’t need to rely on sight alone to understand how to apply for help to buy an equity loan.

There are people who temporarily do not have use of their senses due to illness or injury - such as having an ear infection, burst eardrum or cold.

It’s important to remember that impairments aren’t always permanent.

There are people who temporarily do not have use of their senses due to illness or injury - such as having an ear infection, burst eardrum or cold.

And we must consider people who don’t have full use of their senses because of the situation they’re in - such as being in a noisy environment that prevents you being able to hear as clearly. User needs should be considered whether an impairment or disability is permanent, temporary or situational.

### Accessibility and the law

Equality Act 2010 and Disability Discrimination Act 1995

We have a legal obligation to provide equal access to people with disabilities in the UK and Northern Ireland

In The Equality Act 2010, it says that public authorities must comply with the Public Sector Equality Duty. This means that public organisations, like central and local government, healthcare and education, must think about the needs of people who are disadvantaged or suffer inequality, when they make decisions about how they provide their services and implement policies.

This means we are obliged to:

*   Meet the latest version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) to level AA.
*   Make sure their websites and apps are perceivable, operable, understandable and robust
*   Publish an accessibility statement - this will make clear the level of accessibility across the site or app
*   WCAG is a set of recognised guidelines that can be followed to make components on a website accessible. The guidelines are broken down into three levels.
*   To be compliant with the regulations, we must meet level AA.

#### Understanding WCAG

*   Level A: websites with the most basic web accessibility features
*   Level AA: websites that tackle the most common barriers for disabled users
*   Level AAA: for sites with the highest (and most complex) level of web accessibility

There are important dates with these regulations.

*   Websites published on or after 23 September 2018 already have to be compliant - as of September 2019.
*   Existing websites have to be compliant by 23 September 2020.
*   mobile apps have to be compliant by 23 June 2021.

There are four actions we must should take to make sure our websites and apps are compliant:

1.  Understand how we are impacted by the regulations
2.  Check the accessibility of our websites and/or apps
3.  Make a plan to fix any problems that come out of the accessibility audit
4.  Publish accessibility statements for websites and apps

Accessibility statements are one of the key requirements of the new regulations. Websites should have their own statements and they must include:

*   how accessibility was evaluated
*   the level of compliance
*   known issues
*   how users can get accessible alternatives
*   a feedback mechanism
*   how to contact the enforcement body
*   it must be regularly updated as and when you make changes to websites. Or, at least once a year.

### Monitoring the regulations

The Government Digital Service, or GDS, has a role in making sure compliance with the regulations happens. They monitor and report on the accessibility of public sector websites and mobile apps, and are responsible for enforcing the requirement to publish an accessibility statement. They will also publish their findings.

However, the Equality and Human Rights Commission in Great Britain and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland will enforce the law.

This means they can use their existing legal powers under the Equality Act 2010 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to launch investigations, issue unlawful act notices and take court action against offending organisations.

#### How can you help?

Firstly, I want to touch on document formats. PDFs are one of the most common issues for websites. Any content being published to websites should be published in HTML. PDFs should only be used for printed documents. However, if there are situations when you need to upload a PDF you should publish them as additional documents. HTML should be published by default.

There’s a lot of discussion around PDFs and their accessibility. These documents are created to be printed, so they’re not built to be read on screens. This means they aren’t responsive which can make them challenging to open on mobile and means they aren’t compatible with screen magnification. They aren’t usually structured so can be difficult for screen reader users to navigate.

Using the correct page structures to format your content helps those using screen readers to understand the layout of a document. Each document or page should have one heading, and subheadings can be used to provide a structure to the page or document. You can find and edit the pre-formatted headings and subheadings within the format tab of most programs.

It’s also important that you use a sensible font size. The default paragraph font size is 19px on large screens and 16px on small screens.

Link text is a WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. Links must stand out from other text and have a 3:1 colour contrast ratio between them and the surrounding text. Blue is often used as the default because it isn’t hugely affected by green and red colour blindness.

Link text should be meaningful and make sense without the context of surrounding content. This is to make sure it is accessible to users navigating the content with a keyboard instead of a mouse and those using screen readers that pull together a lists of links.

Colour should not be used to convey a key message. This is why you should avoid using pie charts to demonstrate data as it cannot be understood if a user is colour blind.

You must also make sure there is sufficient contrast between the colour of your text and the background it’s on. WCAG guidelines state that you should have a minimum ratio of 4.5:1. There are free online tools that can be used to check the contrast of colours - contrast checker is a common option.

Alt text is used to describe an image. It’s read by software for visually impaired users and displays when an image doesn’t load.

It’s important that you keep alt text short and simple, including only the information the users needs to know about the message the image is conveying. This means you needn’t include things like ‘picture of’ or ‘image of’

It’s also important that you add alt text to design elements like buttons when creating marketing emails, for example.

Form image buttons must have an alt attribute that describes the function of the button. Image buttons are often used to provide a more visually appealing or a smaller version of the standard form buttons. The alternative text should describe what the button will do when selected, such as "Search", "Submit", "Register", "Place your order", etc. For instance,  might be appropriate for an image button on a site search form.

### Common questions

#### Disproportionate burden:

You may not have to meet the requirements for your whole website or app if doing so would be a disproportionate burden - for example, if it’s very expensive to make even simple changes and those changes would bring very limited benefits to disabled people. If you’re not sure what would be disproportionate in your situation, talk to your legal adviser.

#### Using third party software or outsourcing:

You’re legally responsible for your website meeting accessibility requirements, even if you’ve outsourced your website to a supplier.

#### Internal facing services:

In a 2017 survey, 9.9% of the civil servants who declared their disability status said they were disabled. It’s crucial that your service is fully accessible.
