### Head of Professions

The Heads of Profession Community of Practice (CoP) is a self-organising group that spans across departments and professions with members distributed throughout Digital and Transformation.

The purpose of this Head of Professions Community of Practice is to ensure the representation of the different professions that play an important role in the cultivation, delivery and support of digital products and services and to promote best practice across the organisation.

To maintain it's effectiveness, we share the agenda and associated information prior to the meeting so the relevant people can take the action and follow up offline after the initial discussion at HoP.

### Objectives

The objectives of the CoP will include:

1.  To advise the organisation on new project requests and fulfil initial triaging of pitch decks in the Digital Portfolio.
2.  Formal point of contact on any tactical projects or urgent requests that will have a cross-cutting impact.
3.  To identify, document, review and communicate best practices.
4.  To provide a forum to discuss any resourcing or WIP challenges.
5.  To identify and discuss opportunities for collaboration and strategic alignment of projects.
6.  To report on progress and provide updates of projects and programmes that have dependencies across professions.
