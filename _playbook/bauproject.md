To support leadership and teams determine if a piece of work is BAU or meets the threshold to go through the portfolio front door and governance process. **This will not** cover every use case and should be used as guidance rather than mandated rules. All work should start as a product discussion to understand the problems/outcomes/user needs.

In a service team environment, the team will be in regular communication with their respective business area through an empowered service owner who will guide and support the team to identify and prioritise their backlogs. In the majority of cases, work will follow a simple journey from the backlog to sprint to completion in relatively small chunks delivered iteratively in sprints. However, there may be situations where something is substantial enough or requires specialist skills or would impact the capacity of the team significantly that it requires reviewing and approval through the digital portfolio.

### Continuous Improvement (BAU)

1. In response to customer feedback and are cosmetic or content change to improve usability
2. Low risk technical release which does not require major downtime or change control governance
3. Very low cost and short timescales to get from create to release
4. Not project governance wrapper required and managed within the agile team
5. Standard support & maintenance upgrades and patching which are part of the revenue budget for a live service
6. Bug fixes via the Incident Management route
7. Do not have to go through spend control or a service standard assessment

### Project (Flagged for review by Heads of Profession)

1. Major new features for a service or substantial redesign
2. Development of a new product or service or procurement of a product
3. Requires budget, project management wrapper and will take more than 1 month
4. Have to go through spend control or service standard review to progress
5. Have to go through the organisational approval route or governance as they need budget and resource to deliver project
